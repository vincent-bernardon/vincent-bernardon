ðŸŒŸ Check out our project [Glowing in the dark](https://rakowskimaelis.itch.io/glowing-in-the-dark), a luminous exploration of the intersection between technology and art. Dive into a world where light meets darkness and innovation meets imagination. (Created during the 6th edition of the Code Game Jam, winner of the functionality prize.)ðŸŒŸ

## ðŸ“š Projects completed during my Master IMAGINE (Specialization in Computer Graphics, Vision and Interaction)

- [MinerFabriquer](https://github.com/Kuuro-neko/MinerFabriquer) â€“ Minecraftâ€‘like voxel engine in C++/OpenGL featuring procedural world generation (biomes, caves, ores), realâ€‘time multithreaded chunk loading, PBR rendering, ambient occlusion, and optimized mesh building. Includes survival/creative/spectator modes, block placement/destruction, inventory HUD, TNT and Ender Pearl projectiles, biomeâ€‘based zombie NPCs with animations, and a binary save system with automatic backups.

- [Procedural Climbing Plant Modeling](https://github.com/Akkuun/TER-Procedural-Climbing-Plant-Modeling) â€“ Interactive 3D simulation of procedurally generated climbing plants, inspired by *Interactive Modeling and Authoring of Climbing Plants* (HÃ¤drich et al.). Implemented in JavaScript/TypeScript with Three.js, featuring surface adaptation, phototropism, seed planting, and customizable growth parameters via a LightGUI interface. Includes an octree-based acceleration structure for efficient surface attachment and instanced rendering for performance.

- [Deferred Raytracer](https://github.com/vincent-bernardon/HAI719I-Raytracer) â€“ A custom rendering engine implementing a deferred raytracing pipeline. The application first displays the 3D scene in real time using OpenGL, then generates a more realistic image via raytracing on demand. Developed in C++, it features rayâ€“sphere, rayâ€“plane, and rayâ€“mesh intersection algorithms, Phong shading, hard and soft shadows, mirror reflections, glass refraction with Fresnel effects, texture mapping, and normal mapping. Performance is boosted with a KDâ€‘Tree acceleration structure and multithreaded rendering. Supports applying textures and normal maps to both planes and spheres, with Cornell Box scenes used for testing and validation.

- [EcoPlant](https://github.com/DrHurel/EcoPlant) â€“ Android app developed in Kotlin for identifying plants and managing land parcels. Users can take or upload photos of leaves, flowers, fruits, or bark, then identify them via the Pl@ntNet API, with optional deepâ€‘linking to Tela Botanica for further research. Identified plants can be linked to parcels, which can be created, joined, or managed (public/private, GPS coordinates). Features include user account creation/login, parcel search, plant history, and a map view of joined parcels. Built with a custom Angularâ€‘inspired microâ€‘framework (annotations for services, events, inputs, and pages), XMLâ€‘based UI, and Firebase backend for authentication and data storage.

- [Hex Exploration](https://github.com/Kuuro-neko/Hex-exploration) â€“ 3D implementation of the board game Hex in JavaScript with Three.js, featuring playerâ€‘vsâ€‘AI and AIâ€‘vsâ€‘AI modes. The AI agent uses a Monte Carlo simulation approach to evaluate possible moves through repeated random playouts, selecting the most promising action based on winâ€‘rate statistics. Includes interactive 3D board rendering, camera controls, and full game state management.

- [ML Project](https://github.com/vincent-bernardon/M1_IMAGINE_ML_Project) â€“ Group machine learning project exploring data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation. Implemented in Python (Jupyter Notebook) with scikitâ€‘learn, pandas, and matplotlib, comparing multiple algorithms and tuning hyperparameters to optimise performance on the chosen dataset.

- [Universal 4K Image Compressor](https://github.com/vincent-bernardon/projet-compression-4K) â€“ Developed in C++ with OpenCV, this project explores and implements multiple image compression techniques for ultraâ€‘highâ€‘definition (4K) images. After reviewing JPEG/DCT, Wavelets, Vector Quantization, Fractal compression, and Superpixelâ€‘Driven Graph Transform (SDGT), two main methods were implemented: **SLIC** for superpixel segmentation, and **SDGT** for graphâ€‘based compression. SLIC achieved a PSNR >â€¯30â€¯dB with ~2.1Ã— compression, while SDGT extended this with CIELAB color space, CIEDE2000 distance, clustering, Graph Fourier Transform, and a DCTâ€‘based quantisation stage. A Qt GUI allows users to choose algorithms, adjust parameters, and preview results. Benchmarks on 300 images compared SLIC and SDGT across content types (drawings, films, CGI, photos), revealing strengths, weaknesses, and tradeâ€‘offs in quality, compression ratio, and processing time.


- [Candy Rush](https://github.com/Akkuun/POA-SMA-TeacherProject) â€“ An agentâ€‘oriented programming project where both the teacher and the students can be assigned different AI strategies. Students must collect candies without being caught, and the game compares the performance of each strategy. Built in JavaScript with PIXI.js for rendering, with all game logic, physics, and AI behaviours fully implemented by our team. The goal was to explore how multiple agent strategies can be applied to the same scenario and evaluate their effectiveness.
  
- [Wish Tank](https://github.com/Akkuun/POA-SMA-Tank-Project) â€“ A competitive JavaScript game inspired by Wii Tank, developed to learn how to design and program autonomous agents. The rendering was implemented using PIXI.js, while all the physics and game logic were entirely developed by our team.


  
Project completed during my Computer Science degree : 
- [Bouggr](https://github.com/Akkuun/TER_L3_2023_Boggle_Mobile) â€“ Developed a cross-platform mobile application using Flutter, inspired by the classic Boggle board game. All team members were part of the Development Team, and I also took on the additional role of Scrum Master. I learned and applied Flutter throughout the project, and we optimized the app for mobile devices to minimize battery consumption.
  
- [Relational Database Project](https://github.com/DrHurel/projetBDD) â€“ Academic project applying relational database normalization laws (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF) to design an optimized schema, with SQL scripts for creation/deletion, data insertion, queries, triggers, and functions in PostgreSQL.
  
- [Node.js Project](https://github.com/vincent-bernardon/projet_web) â€“ A web game developed with Node.js to learn it.
  
  
Some projects that I completed during my Computer Science DUT (University Technology Diploma):
- [Ricochet-Robot](https://github.com/vincent-bernardon/Ricochet-Robot) â€“ Project realized in JAVA and JAVAFX, translating the board game Ricochet-Robot into software, complete with an artificial intelligence that finds the shortest path. This project enhanced my understanding of JAVA and JAVAFX, and also provided me with the opportunity to learn and apply design patterns.
  
- [RealWater2](https://github.com/vincent-bernardon/RealWater2) â€“ This project has been developed in PHP to create an e-commerce site, which allowed me to learn PHP.
  
- [PALLL](https://webinfo.iutmontp.univ-montp2.fr/~lemeyeurr/wordpress/) â€“ A project carried out with Wordpress that allowed associations to create their own website. This project allowed me to learn Agile methodologies.
  
- [Bang!IHM](https://github.com/IUTInfoMontp-M2105/projetihm-BernardonBravoBurnichonGregoire) â€“ Development of the Bang digital game interface in JAVAfx, which also allowed me to learn JAVAfx.
  
- [Bang!](https://github.com/IUTInfoMontp-M2103/projetbang-bernardonburnichonbravogregoire) â€“ Digital version of the Bang board game in JAVA. This project allowed me to gain valuable experience in object-oriented programming with JAVA. Unfortunately, the source code is no longer accessible because the GitHub group was deleted by the organization.
